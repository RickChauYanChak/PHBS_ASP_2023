# PHBS_ASP_2023

This is a repository for the homeworks and project of the course [*Applied Stochastic Processes*](https://github.com/PHBS/ASP) offered by Prof. Jaehyuk Choi at Peking University HSBC Business School.

- HW1 is to price spread options and basket options based on the Bachelier model and the BSM model, and control variate method is also implemented
- HW2 is to price European options based on the SABR model, where the special cases of $\beta=0$ and $\beta=1$ are implemented
- Final project is the implementation of [Ma and Wu (2022)](#Ma2022), which is a novel algorithm to simulate rough Heston processes
